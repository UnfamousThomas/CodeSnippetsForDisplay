# CodeSnippetsForDisplay
A small repository for displaying small snippets from different projects, classes, homework etc that do not need a separate repository.

**IMPORTANT:** This repository has loads of things done in a hurry, as well as things done in classes (in Estonian). Most things do not have comments.
It does also have some done for a cloud class in ./cloud as well as some done for C++ class in ./cpp.
